0x07. React Redux Action Creator + Normalizr
This project explores the integration of Redux action creators and the use of the Normalizr library to flatten complex JSON objects in a React-Redux environment.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this project, you will have a deep understanding of the following concepts:

Normalizrâ€™s Purpose and Usage: Learn how to leverage Normalizr to simplify and normalize nested JSON objects.
Schemas and Normalization: Understand how to create schemas and normalize deeply nested JSON structures for easier state management.
Core Concepts of Redux: Gain a solid grasp of fundamental Redux principles, including the store, reducers, and actions.
Redux Actions: Understand how actions serve as the mechanism for communicating changes to the Redux store.
Redux Action Creators: Learn how to create action creators that return action objects, facilitating clean and maintainable Redux code.
Async Actions in Redux: Explore how to handle asynchronous operations within Redux using middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.
Writing Tests for Redux: Learn best practices for testing Redux components, including action creators and reducers.
Overview
In this project, you will:

Use Redux to manage global application state.
Implement Redux action creators to dispatch actions and modify the store.
Use Normalizr to transform complex, nested JSON data into normalized entities.
Create unit tests to ensure the correctness of Redux actions, reducers, and asynchronous logic.
