Project Title: React Component States and Lifecycle
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone without external references:

1. State of a Component or Container
Understand what the state is and how it represents the dynamic data within a component or a container.
2. Component Lifecycle
Familiarize yourself with the lifecycle phases of a React component, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting.
Learn how lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate) are used to control component behavior.
3. Modifying State and Executing Code in the Right Order
Learn how to properly modify a component's state using setState and ensure that updates occur in the correct order.
Understand how React handles asynchronous state updates and how to manage code execution efficiently.
4. Controlled Components
Understand what controlled components are and how they differ from uncontrolled components.
Learn how to handle user inputs in forms using controlled components.
5. Forms in React
Learn how to build and manage forms in React, including handling form inputs, validation, and submission.
6. Reusing Smaller Components
Discover best practices for creating reusable, pure components.
Learn how to lift state from smaller components to principal containers to avoid duplication and ensure a clean architecture.
7. React Hooks
Understand how to use React Hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) to manage state and lifecycle without writing class components.
Learn how to create custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic.
8. Testing State Changes with Enzyme
Learn how to use the Enzyme testing utility to test state changes and simulate component interactions.
